          <p class="first-new-description">Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson and Jordan Henderson are set to be fit for Sunday’s clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers, but Liverpool will be without Roberto Firmino for their final Premier League game of the season.<br>

          <br>Forward Salah missed the remarkable Champions League victory over Barcelona due to a concussion sustained in last weekend’s win at Newcastle United, while Robertson was forced off at half-time of the semi-final second leg with a calf problem.<br>

          <br>Jordan Henderson completed the 90 minutes against Barca on Tuesday but did so only after suffering a knee injury in the closing stages of the first half.<br>

          <br>Klopp, though, is hopeful on the trio’s availability for the meeting with Wolves at Anfield - a game the Reds go into one point behind Manchester City at the top of the table.<br>

          <br>Firmino, however, remains sidelined with a muscle issue.<br>

          <br><strong>Klopp's message for the final day of the title race</strong><br>

          <br>“The famous three words of this week in the dressing room: ‘It’s only pain’,” the boss said on Friday.<br>

          <br>“Very important for all the young lads to learn, I’ve said that already to the boys. Hendo said, ‘It’s only pain’, Robbo said, ‘It’s only pain’ - but it was real pain, wow!<br>

          <br>“Unfortunately, Robbo could deal with the pain but only the rest of his body couldn’t because he couldn’t really activate the muscle anymore, some nerve hit or whatever. They should be fine [for Sunday].<br>

          <br>“Bobby not [available] for the weekend, but we have time [before the Champions League final] and that should be enough.<br>

          <br>“Mo looked good around the celebrations after the game, to be honest! The day before yesterday and yesterday he was running outside and will be part of training today.” <br>
